# sorting

Comparison of different sorting algorithms at various array sizes. With Katherine Tian

# Motivation

An exercise in comparing different sorting algorithms and their speeds in python at various array sizes. The time complexities of theses algorithms are well known - this is an exercise in practical execution speed in a python environment.

# Algorithms

These are the included algorithms we are testing
| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Insert | Ω(n) | Θ(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Merge | Ω(n*log(n)) | Θ(n*log(n)) | O(n*log(n)) |
| Bubble | Ω(n) | Θ(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Quick | Ω(n*log(n)) | Θ(n*log(n)) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Timsort | Ω(n) | Θ(n*log(n)) | O(n\*log(n)) |

# sorting
Comparison of different sorting algorithms at various array sizes. With Katherine Tian

# Motivation
An exercise in comparing different sorting algorithms and their speeds in python at various array sizes. The time complexities of theses algorithms are well known - this is an exercise in practical execution speed in a python specific environment.

# Algorithms
These are the included algorithms we are testing
| Algorithm      | Best | Average | Worst |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Insert    | Ω()       | Θ()      | O()       |
| Merge     | Ω()       | Θ()      | O()       |
| Bubble    | Ω()       | Θ()      | O()       |
| Quick     | Ω()       | Θ()      | O()       |
| Timsort   | Ω()       | Θ()      | O()       |
